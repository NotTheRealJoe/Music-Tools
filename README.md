# Music-Tools
This is a set of tools that I use on the command line to manage my music library
on Linux.

## music-portable.sh
Looks in the Music directory and converts songs to make them able to be played
by my mobile device or car stereo (e.g. converts non-MP3 files to mp3).

**Requirements:** ffmpeg, libmp3lame, bash
